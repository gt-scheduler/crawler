How do users behave in different security contexts, and why do they behave in those (often insecure) ways? Gaining this understanding is vital for driving improvements in real-world security. This seminar-style course will cover both classic and recent empirical security studies across a wide range of security topics, including Internet security, underground ecosystems, usable security, and online privacy.
